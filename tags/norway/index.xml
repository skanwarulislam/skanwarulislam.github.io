      <description>From today 1st of October 2021, I am staring my parental leave (pappa permisjon) for next 5 months, which I was looking forward to (My wife won&amp;rsquo;t agree :D). When my first son was 8 month, I moved to norway pursuing better future and missed all the good part about being a father. I have missed my baby&amp;rsquo;s first step, his first words, and the list goes on. Plus in bangladesh the parental leave for father was only 2 weeks and so after the birth there not much of live and family that you can cherish.</description>
