      <description>From today 1st of October 2021, I am staring my parental leave (pappa permisjon) for next 5 months, which I was looking forward to (My wife won&amp;rsquo;t agree :D). When my first son was 8 month, I moved to norway pursuing better future and missed all the good part about being a father. I have missed my baby&amp;rsquo;s first step, his first words, and the list goes on. Plus in bangladesh the parental leave for father was only 2 weeks and so after the birth there not much of live and family that you can cherish.</description>

      <description>I have been trying to create my own website for sometime now but never been able to finish it. Finally, this time I was determined and started this initiative. I will try to post things that I face or experience every day. It could be technical challenges, social challenges, human aspects/views, or just something about life. Another reason is to document useful things here, which are easy to forget so that I can just look into it whenever I need it.</description>

      <description>Hi! I am Anwar. I am a technology enthusiast with solid experience building and maintaining enterprise solutions into public cloud. I like to code and build stuff, it could be a complicated service, some automation script, a robust CI/CD pipelines or simple config changes. If makes me happy and gives me a test of achievement when I see those small things are adding value. Nowadays I am interested in Authentication and Authorization and security aspects around it.</description>
